BoltJwt - Json Web Token provider 
---
*Simplified authentication service based on JWT.*

#### What's is it?
**BoltJwt** is a tiny .Net Core authentication service. Built as **docker image**, 
it's easy to integrate into docker-based web projects that use **JWT** technology.   

> Users, groups, roles, and permissions can be configurable via a backoffice web application.

Bolt Jwt share his **public key**. The services can then consume the generated tokens.
Every token contains some 'private claims' like the user configured authorizations.
